Description: The package can be used to analyze microarray and RNA-seq GEO datasets after analyzed from GEO2R for 
             immune cell contributions based on InnateDB database and can also predict if these genes partcipate 
             in the Adaptive immune system or not.Along with the informational function, we have a function to
             scdevelop multiple and useful graphs to provide insights to the scientist working on the data.
