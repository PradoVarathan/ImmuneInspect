# ImmuneInspect
R package 
Alzheimer’s Disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects 24 million people worldwide. Lymphocytes, such as T regulatory and T helper 17 cells, have been implicated in disease pathogenesis and progression. Previous research has demonstrated that the Treg population is significantly diminished in AD patients compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, there is an imbalance of circulating Tregs and Th17 cells in AD patients. By designing an R program, we will be able to characterize differential gene expression of lymphocyte-related genes from RNA-seq and microarray data. To elucidate the role of these lymphocytes in Alzheimer’s disease, we will use published and publicly available microarray data on human brains of 27 control and 52 AD subjects. Our analysis will mainly focus on the differential immune-related gene expression within the regions of the brain. Specifically, our R package can be used to identify innate and adaptive immune cell types. Transcriptomic activity within the three groups would support that lymphocytes such as Tregs or Th17 cells, play important regulatory roles in AD pathogenesis and progression.
